## Data

- Note: AMOC observational data is stored here: ``/albedo/work/projects/p_pool_clim_data/ERA5/amoc/Johns_2023_mht_data_2020_ERA5/mocha_mht_data_ERA5_v2020.nc``.

- Observational data: for reducing the uncertainties of the observational data, it is recommended to use several different observational datasets (also done in Brunner et al.)

- sea-surface temperature (tos), use mask?

- check the error with Branch_time_in_parent (now files are just excluded)

### Plots

- Fix tos-plot something went wrong here!
- Finish AMOC plot


## Weights

- implement different definition of weighted quantiles
- implement distances for sea-ice extent

## Program

- implement proper logging instead of logging to console
- update tests! and add where missing
- in plot-utils check Lookups for negative values when lookup values had been changed!
- update documentation!

## CLIMWIP

- add used diagnostics to metadata, now this is not saved, for every variable
different diagnostics might be used
- check units in performance weights plots
- check why I get more missing data than they in climwip replicated temp map/graph plots
